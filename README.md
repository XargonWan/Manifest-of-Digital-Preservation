The "Manifest of Digital Preservation" sets forth a comprehensive plan to safeguard digital content for the future. It covers a range of crucial aspects, including the protection of various types of media, ensuring easy access for all, removing digital rights management (DRM) restrictions, distributing preservation efforts, ensuring compatibility with evolving technologies, promoting open access to information, advocating for transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI), and preserving Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) repositories. By embracing these principles, the manifest aims to make certain that valuable digital resources remain available, usable, and accessible to everyone, emphasizing the significance of digital preservation in an ever-evolving technological landscape.
